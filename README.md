# CamperKids 🎒☀️

**CamperKids** is an Android application that helps parents in Greece find and book summer camps for their children. The app functions as a centralized platform where camps can be searched, filtered, and explored—making the camp selection process faster, easier, and more transparent.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a student project developed for the **Interactive applications for mobile devices** course, MSc. Technologies of Interactive Stystems. While functional, it is not yet production-ready.
